A port of the [monoindustrial](http://inkdeep.github.io/TextMate-Themes/#monoindustrial) TextMate theme, for Nova.

Monoindustrial is a dark green-based theme, with purple, red, and orange accenting colours.

Should provide both an editor and a document theme.

This theme is a work-in-progress.

If you're the original author of Monoindustrial for TextMate, please get in touch so I can add you to the contributors :)
